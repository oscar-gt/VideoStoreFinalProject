This system uses a driver (assignment4driver.cpp), a business layer, and factories for movies and commands to
accomplish the requirements specified for this assignment. The driver reads in each line from an
input file and passes the line to the appropriate factory. However, we chose not to include a
customer factory, because there is only one class of customer, so the driver creates customers
directly.

Movies are stored in a linked list of binary trees, with each node of the list representing a
different category. We chose this design to maintain the order specified in the assignment while
allowing each list to use different overloaded comparison methods to account for different
search procedures. Customer information is stored in a hashmap for fast lookup. Customer
history is stored in a linked list associated with each customer object. We chose a linked list
because the only command to be executed on the linked list is to print it in order, and a linked
list is sufficient for this procedure.
